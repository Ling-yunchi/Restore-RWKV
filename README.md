## Dataset

You can download the preprocessed datasets for MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis from Baidu Netdisk [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1oBBG_Stcn7cfO8U49S146w?pwd=3x13 ).

The original dataset for MRI super-resolution and CT denoising are as follows:

- MRI super-resolution: [IXI dataset](http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/)

- CT denoising: [AAPM dataset](https://www.aapm.org/grandchallenge/lowdosect/)
